          The Montessori teaching approach is based on research results that
          indicate students learn efficiently and deeply in an enriched,
          supportive environment through exploration, discovery and the freedom
          to use their creativity. In a Montessori classroom, each student
          learns and develops at his/her own pace through the use of materials
          and lessons introduced by staff trained in the Montessori teaching
          approach. This training is in addition to that required by the state
          of California for teacher licensure. The Montessori training program
          course of study includes educational philosophy, academic training in
          the curricula areas, child development, classroom management, use of
          materials for individual lessons, scaffolding of instruction, and
          differentiation of instruction.

          The Montessori teaching approach also includes specific materials and
          methods developed by Dr. Maria Montessori, as well as materials and
          content added by teachers to educate students to 21st century
          standards. Materials are selected and designed to meet the needs of
          the individual student, and there is a range of materials both in
          variety and level of development to allow children to progress through
          the curriculum as their skills develop.

          The integrated curriculum is introduced sequentially and at the
          developmental level of each individual child, allowing every child to
          work to capacity at his/her ability level. Students receive lessons
          and complete work individually, in small groups, and in whole-class
          groupings. Teachers guide and teach content so as to address the
          development of social skills, emotional growth, physical coordination,
          and cognitive preparation within the thoughtfully designed classroom
          and school-wide environments. This teaching approach supports the
          Buckeye Union School District goal of “promoting the development of
          each student as a whole person.”

          Students choose their academic activities in a prepared environment;
          however, the teacher initially defines the boundaries of activities.
          The class will then work in partnership with the teacher to define the
          boundaries of acceptable behavior and activity. Eventually the goal is
          that each child will define his/her own boundaries of right and wrong
          and consistent with the standards of the school community. Within
          limits, students are free to choose their own work, work at their own
          pace, and to move around and collaborate with others in the classroom.
          The limits imposed are in relation to the collective interest, and
          this means that children learn to have respect for the rights and
          safety of others and for the environment. Students who disrupt their
          own work or that of others are redirected by the teacher. Children
          learn to use care with materials, to help other children and to become
          a cooperative member of the group. This enables each child to enjoy
          the freedom which is offered, while displaying and developing
          discipline. This freedom develops the ability of the child to make
          reasoned educational and interpersonal choices based on a framework of
          self-discipline.

          Many Montessori classroom materials are self-correcting, which means
          students are able to self-assess and evaluate progress toward a
          learning goal prior to a formal assessment. Students are also
          encouraged to peer assess as a form of review prior to a formal
          assessment. Once students have demonstrated mastery of a concept via
          formal or informal assessment metrics, they are given the next lesson
          in the sequence.
