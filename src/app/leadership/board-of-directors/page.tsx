              Greg Fuson is the proud parent of two creative, inquisitive,
              Rising Sun-educated children. He is a conference planner with 25
              years of experience designing educational events infused with art,
              music, drama, emotion and entertainment. Because, to paraphrase
              Maya Angelou, within a short time people won’t remember
              specifically what you told them—but years later they’ll recall
              with perfect clarity how you made them feel. Greg has served on
              the Rising Sun board since 2020.

              As a third generation Sacramento area resident who attended
              elementary, middle, and high schools in Folsom, I value the
              emphasis which residents of our region place on education. The
              parental support and involvement found here is impressive and
              leads to a better community. I am a parent of two children who are
              educated in El Dorado Hills and I am reminded on a regular basis
              of the commitment which parents make to improve their children’s
              lives. I have been volunteering in area schools since 2018 and
              enjoy learning from a student’s perspective. As a volunteer on the
              board of Rising Sun Montessori School it’s my goal to help ensure
              your children receive support with their education. My family
              moved to El Dorado Hills in 2014 from Fair Oaks because we noticed
              the difference in the quality of education and how students
              benefit from more volunteers supporting the classroom. As a real
              estate agent since 2016 I have been able to help others who see
              value in education establish their families here. Improving our
              community through residents who place their children’s needs above
              their own is a rewarding occupation. Before real estate I also had
              several decades in sales and support of appliances, audio, and
              video in both residential and commercial applications. I have a
              Bachelor’s of Science degree in Business Management and an
              Associate of Arts degree. I graduated from Folsom High School in
              1995. You may see me at kid’s soccer games and swim team meets and
              I welcome you to contact me anytime.

              Professionally, Tiffany serves as the Chief People & Culture
              Officer for Mercy Medical Group. She has enjoyed a 20-year career
              in Human Resources with a dedicated focus on organizational

              On a personal front, Tiffany has two children, both of whom either
              have attended or are still attending Rising Sun Montessori (RSMS).
              Her son, now 17 and at the start of his senior year attended RSMS
              from 6th-8th grade. Transitioning from a traditional public school
              to RSMS ha life changing impacts for her son. Mr. Karl in
              particular was an incredibly positive influence, helping him
              realize his capabilities and potential, natural approaches that
              encouraged him to think for himself. He regularly regards Mr. Karl
              as his favorite teacher. Her daughter, now in 4th grade, has
              attended RSMS since kindergarten. The educational approach of the
              Montessori Method has brought out the natural leadership within
              her children, coping skills that are transferable and timeless.
            </p>
            <p>
              It is for this reason that Tiffany was enthusiastic to join the
              RSMS Board. She has great passion to help contribute additional
              ways to maintain resources and child programs that enhance/secure
              the sustainability of the school. Tiffany Waterhouse (Tidwell) has
              served on the Rising Sun Montessori Board of Directors since June
              2023.
