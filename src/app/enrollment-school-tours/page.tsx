            Proof of Montessori experience or residency may be dropped off in
            the front office or scanned and emailed to the above email address.
            These must be received by the end of February for priority in the
            lottery. This does not apply to applications received March 1 or
            later, as those students will be added to the waitlist or offered
            enrollment (if space is available in that grade) in the order they
            are received.

            If Rising Sun receives more new student applications in the first
            enrollment period (January through the end of February) than
            available space, parents will be notified via email and a lottery
            will take place, in March, on our campus at 4940 Robert J Mathews
            Parkway in El Dorado Hills. Parents/Guardians need not be present to
            have their student considered in the lottery drawing. After the
            lottery drawing is completed, parents/guardians will be notified via
            email of either their admission to Rising Sun, or their placement on
            a waiting list, as well as their wait list number. Parents/Guardians
            will then have five business days to reply with their acceptance of
            the offer to enroll or placement on the waiting list at Rising Sun
            for the upcoming school year. Parents/Guardians who do not respond
            with acceptance of either admission or placement on the wait list
            within five business days will be removed from the current
            enrollment pool and will have to re-apply during our second
            enrollment cycle, which will begin in March.

              As a non-sectarian, tuition-free public school, Rising Sun
              Montessori School will admit all grade-level eligible pupils who
              wish to attend, up to the Charter School’s capacity, in accordance
              with Education Code Section 47605(e)(2)(A). Rising Sun Montessori
              will be a school of choice and in compliance with Education Code
              Section 47605(g), no student will be required to attend Rising

              residence of the pupil or of his/her parent or guardian. However,
              in the event of a public random drawing, admissions preference
              shall be granted to residents of the Buckeye Union School
              District. In accordance with Education Code Sections 49011 and
              47605(e)(2)(B)(iv), admission preferences shall not require
              mandatory parental volunteer hours as a criterion for admission or
              continued enrollment.
              <br />
              <br />
              Rising Sun Montessori School shall abide by Education Code Section
              47605(e)(1) and shall not charge tuition, nor discriminate against
              any pupil on the basis of the characteristics listed in Education
              Code Section 220 (actual or perceived disability, gender, gender
              expression, gender identity, nationality, race or ethnicity,
              religion, sexual orientation, or any other characteristic that is

              422.55 of the Penal Code, including immigration status, or
              association with an individual who has any of the aforementioned
              characteristics). In accordance with Education Code Section 48000
              (a)-(c), children must meet minimum age requirements for
              enrollment. Rising Sun will abide by any future amendments to the
              Education Code regarding minimum and maximum age for public
              schools. Proof of the child’s age must be presented at the time of
              enrollment as described in Education Code Section 48002.

              In accordance with Education Code Section 47605(e)(4)(A), the
              Charter School shall not discourage a pupil from enrolling or
              seeking to enroll in the charter school for any reason, including,
              but not limited to, academic performance of the pupil or because
              the pupil exhibits any of the characteristics described in
              Education Code Section 47605(e)(2)(B)(iii), including pupils with
              disabilities, academically low-achieving pupils, English learners,
              neglected or delinquent pupils, homeless pupils, or pupils who are
              economically disadvantaged, as determined by eligibility for any
              free or reduced-price meal program, foster youth, or pupils based
              on nationality, race, ethnicity, or sexual orientation. Similarly,
              in accordance with Section 47605(e)(4)(C), the Charter School
              shall not encourage a pupil currently attending the Charter School
              to disenroll from the Charter School or transfer to another school
              for any reason, including, but not limited to the academic
              performance of the pupil or because the pupil exhibits any of the

              <br />
              Rising Sun Montessori School shall admit all students who wish to
              attend the Charter School. The Charter School shall require
              students who wish to attend the Charter School to complete an
              application form. After admission, students shall be required to
              submit an enrollment packet, which includes the following:
              <br />
              <br />
              1. Student enrollment form <br />
              2. Proof of Immunization <br />
              3. Home Language Survey <br />
              4. Completion of Emergency Medical Information Form <br />
              5. Proof of minimum age requirements <br />
              6. Release of records <br /> <br />
              Rising Sun Montessori School shall make application and enrollment
              forms available in English and Spanish. Open enrollment shall
              begin on the first business day in January and extend through the
              end of February. Forms shall be available at the school site and
              through participation in any Parent Information Meeting that may
              be held throughout the open enrollment period. Submitted
              application forms shall be date and time stamped and student names
              added to an application roster to track receipt. If, by the close
              of open enrollment, the number of forms received is less than the
              number of spaces available, all applicants shall be accepted and
              enrolled in the Charter School upon submission of an enrollment
              packet. Subsequent application forms shall be accepted until our
              capacity is reached.

              <b>Public Random Drawing</b> <br />
              <br />
              Following the open enrollment period each year, applications shall
              be counted to determine whether any grade level has received more
              applications than availability. In the event that this happens,
              the Charter School shall hold a public random drawing (or
              “lottery”) for the impacted grade level(s), with the exception of
              students currently enrolled in the Charter School, who are
              guaranteed admission in the following school year.
              <br />
              <br />
              Admissions preference in the case of a lottery will be given in
              the following sequence of priority:
              <br />
              <br />
              1. Siblings of students admitted to or attending Rising Sun
              <br />
              2. Children of Rising Sun employees
              <br />
              3. Children of the Rising Sun founding team
              <br />
              4. Children with one year prior Montessori experience
              <br />
              5. Children who reside within the boundaries of Buckeye Union
              School District
              <br />
              6. All other applicants
              <br />
              <br />
              The Charter School and the District agree to adhere to the
              requirements related to admission preferences as set forth in
              Education Code Section 47605(e)(2)(B)(i)-(iv).
              <br />
              <br />
              Families who submit completed application forms prior to the
              February deadline shall be notified in writing regarding the date,
              time, and location of the public lottery, and rules for the
              lottery process. The lottery drawing shall be held on the school
              grounds in March. Results shall be published in English and
              Spanish, and shall be posted online and in hard copy in previously
              determined locations. Results shall also be e-mailed to all
              applicants and follow-up phone calls shall be made.
              <br />
              <br />
              The Board of Directors will take all necessary efforts to ensure
              lottery procedures are fairly executed. Lottery spaces are pulled
              in order of grade level by the designated lottery official
              (appointed by the Head of School). Separate lotteries shall be
              conducted for each grade in which there are fewer vacancies than
              pupils interested in attending. All lotteries shall take place on
              the same day in a single location. Lotteries will be conducted in
              ascending order beginning with the lowest applicable grade level.
              There is no weighted priority assigned to the preference
              categories; rather, within each grade level, students will be
              drawn from pools beginning with all applicants who qualify for the
              first preference category, and shall continue with that preference
              category until all vacancies within that grade level have been
              filled. If there are more students in a preference category than
              there are spaces available, a random drawing will be held from
              within that preference category until all available spaces are
              filled. If all students from the preference category have been
              selected and there are remaining spaces available in that grade
              level, students from the second preference category will be drawn
              in the lottery, and the drawing shall continue until all spaces
              are filled and preference categories are exhausted in the order
              provided above.
              <br />
              <br />
              Families of students who are offered admission shall have 5
              business days to confirm in writing their intent to enroll and
              submit an enrollment packet including proof of age, proof of
              address, and immunization records. Any families who decline
              admission or who fail to confirm shall lose their position to the
              next name on the waiting list. The waiting list shall be kept on
              file at the Charter School and be valid for the duration of the
              school year for which it was formed. If a student leaves the
              Charter School, that space will be offered to the next person on
              the waiting list. In no circumstance will a waiting list carry
              over to the following school year.
